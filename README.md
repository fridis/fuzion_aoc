# Fuzion Advent of Code

Advent of Code solutions using Fuzion

The goal is to use Fuzion to solve Advent-of-Code tasks and to learn from this
to improve the Fuzion base library and maybe even the Fuzion language itself.

See [Advent of Code](adventofcode.com) for details.

I leave dirty versions of the code with comments on what should be improved in
Fuzion in the repositories as a reminder for what to fix.  The clean versions
might get improved over time as Fuzion gets improved.
